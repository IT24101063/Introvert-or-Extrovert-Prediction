# Introvert-or-Extrovert-Prediction
This model is a simple tool that guesses if someone is an introvert or extrovert. It looks at features like how much time you spend alone or if you feel tired after hanging out with people. Our model uses a dataset with questions about daily habits to make this prediction. First, we preprocessed the dataset by fixing missing answers and removing outliers. Then, we turned yes/no answers into numbers so the computer can understand them. We also made sure all the numbers are on the same scale to keep things fair. After that, we simplified the data using a method that combines similar info into fewer parts. Finally, we trained the model with different techniques and picked the best one, like a smart decision-maker called XGBoost. It learns patterns from the data, such as introverts liking more alone time. To use it, you answer a few questions, and it predicts your personality type. We tested it and got good accuracy, around 95%.
